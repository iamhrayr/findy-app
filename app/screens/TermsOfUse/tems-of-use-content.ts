      available for use in locations outside the United States, and accessing and using the
      Service is prohibited from territories where doing so would be illegal. Users that

    </p>
    <p>
      The Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
      the State of New York, excluding its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of
      America. In the event of any conflict between US and foreign laws, rules and

      Terms of Service. User expressly agrees that the exclusive jurisdiction for any claim
      or action arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service or use of the Site or
      Service shall be in the state of New York, USA, and User further agrees and submits to
      the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any
      such claim or action. Use of the Service is not authorized in any jurisdiction that
      does not give effect to all provisions of the Terms of Service, including without
      limitation, this section.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>14. INTEGRATION AND SEVERABILITY.</h3>
  <div>
    <p>

      and Routehappy with respect to access, use and operation of the Service, and supersede
      all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or
      electronic) between User and Routehappy with respect to the Service. If any provision
      of the Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will
      be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Service
      will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
